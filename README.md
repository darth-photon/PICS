# Introduction

I present the numerical package **P**article **I**nteractions **C**ascade equation **S**olver, a.k.a **PICS**, that can be used to estimate bounds on new physics parameters from interactions in astrophysical and cosmological sources. Two example models have also been provided that demonstrate all the options available. 

# Installation
